# Monego

## The beloved Monaco monospaced font, recreated with bold and italic variants. Finally.

Bold and italic variants of Monaco were originally recreated by @vjpr but seem to be abandoned now. Font integration problems were fixed by me. Bold-italic version by @kokoko3k.

## The fonts variants

A patched version with ligatures made with [Ligaturizer 2.0](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer) is also available.  
NOTE: Due to [a unresolved issue with Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer/issues/74), the kerning is not ideal.

Another patched version with ligatures and [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) glyps is also available.

## Install
